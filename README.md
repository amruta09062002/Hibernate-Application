## Introduction
This project demonstrates the use of Hibernate ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) for database operations in a Java application. It includes basic CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) with Hibernate, as well as examples of HQL (Hibernate Query Language) queries.

## Project Setup
### Prerequisites
- **Java**: JDK 8 or later
- **Maven**: 3.x or later
- **Database**: MySQL (or any other RDBMS)
- **IDE**: IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or any other Java IDE

### Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/hibernate-project.git
cd hibernate-project

##Technologies Used
- Hibernate: 5.x or later
- Java: JDK 8 or later
- MySQL: 8.x (or any other supported RDBMS)
- Maven: 3.x or later

##Configuration
###Database Configuration
You need to configure the database connection in the hibernate.cfg.xml file located in the src/main/resources directory.

##Running the Application
- Ensure your database is up and running.
- Update the hibernate.cfg.xml file with your database credentials.
- Run the main method in your Java class that initiates Hibernate operations (e.g., Client6.java).
